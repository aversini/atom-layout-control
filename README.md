# n-panes package

Sublime Text-like n-column layout shortcuts for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

- Use **cmd+alt+\[n\]** (where n is a number between 1 and 4) to set the layout to n adjacent vertical panes.
- Use **cmd+shift+alt+\[n\]** (where n is 2 or 3) for n adjacent horizontal panes.
- Use **cmd+alt+5** for a 4 panes grid.

E.g. cmd+alt+3 will create a 3-pane vertical layout.
